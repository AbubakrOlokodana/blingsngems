While the white gold is mixed with white metals like nickel, yellow gold is mixed with yellow metals like copper. However, the  cost of white gold and yellow gold is relatively the same as they are both made of gold and other alloy metals.</p>

        <summary>What precious metal is the jewelry made from?</summary>
        <p class="text">All our pieces are made from either gold, platinum or another type of metal. We often make use of 18ct yellow, white and rose gold to make fine jewellery and platinum is chosen for our bridal or diamond jewellery as it’s very hardwearing.</p>

But the metals (like silver, copper, and nickel) that are mixed with gold oxidizes when it's exposed to air, sweat, makeup, and other chemicals hence why we provide after care and instructions on how to clean and care for your jewelries.</p>
